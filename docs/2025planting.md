# 2025 Planting

## Probably Too Late

* Kenzie and I pre-germinated tomatoes, peas, and pumpkins using just wet paper towels in baggies, March 22, 2025
* 6 tomatoes, 6 peas, 3 pumpkins
* Once germinated, I planted them into individual starter-pots, March 28th, under the Click&Grow 
* Claire gifted us a new starter - I moved it to the main floor bedroom, March 22, 2025.  It took off!
