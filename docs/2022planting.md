# 2022 Planting

* April 9, 2022: Sharon gifted a [Click'n'Grow](https://www.amazon.ca/Click-Grow-Smart-Garden-Indoor/dp/B08ZJD2C4B/ref=sr_1_27?keywords=click+and+grow&qid=1650294347&sprefix=click+%2Caps%2C315&sr=8-27) which turned out to be wonderful!  She got it at BestBuy.
* I "planted" arugula, basil, and thyme -- one of each type that Sharon supplied with the kit.
