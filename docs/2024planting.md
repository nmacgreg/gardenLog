# 2024 Planting

## Early

* Kenzie and I planted tomatoes, parsley, and basil using the automated light thingy, I think it was Feb 13, 2024
* I moved the Click&Grow to the sewing room, b/c Regan didn't like it in the front window of the living room, last year.
* Mar 24, 2024:
    * only one tomato and one parsley have sprouted; the tomato is getting leggy
    * [this video on leggy tomatoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbDgbIPkK0) suggests that a quick re-potting, sinking the stem lower, will encourage deep root growth and leaf-ing out.  Grow-lights are recommended, but I think I've got that covered.
    * I overfilled the water reservior - the surface of the dirt was always glossy-wet.  Having never added any water, the water is now low, although the dirt still glossy-wet & has grown some moss, and seems to have settled.
    * I read that tomatoe seedlings should be kept warm & a grow-mat (eg something like an electric blanket) is suggested, even under a covered plastic seedling-starter
